### About this event

How does model architecture, pre-training objective, the side of the dataset and parameter count affect model's linguistic abilities? They don't 🤯. Or at least not as directly we thought.
Evaluation of generated text remains a significant issue. Recently-introduced model-based metrics have shown promising results compared to n-gram-based metrics like BLEU, yet they still suffer severe drawbacks (http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10696).
