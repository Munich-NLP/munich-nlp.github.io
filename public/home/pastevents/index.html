<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>I will talk about how in the social sciences (primarily political and communication science), neural NLP is being used
to measure constructs of interest that have previously been measured by hand coding.
I illustrate this with results from experiments on parliament speeches and party manifestos from the
last legislative period in Germany (2017-2021). One key issue I want to discuss (and where social science and computer science sometimes have a different understanding) is measurement validity.</p>

<p>What does robot judege/ Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) model actually predict from? I will talk about that neural LJP models without expert-informed adjustments can be vulnerable to shallow, distracting surface signals. Our experiments on neural LJP predicting European Court of Human Rights cases  shows adversarial training can help better align models with experts, and in many cases can even achieve better prediction performance.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Research on multi-class text classification of short texts mainly focuses on supervised (transfer) learning approaches, requiring a finite set of pre-defined classes which is constant over time. This talk covers deep constrained clustering (CC) as an alternative to supervised learning approaches in a setting with a dynamically changing number of classes, a task we introduce as dynamic topic discovery (DTD).

<p>Presenting and communicating the outcomes of your analysis has never been more engaging. Say goodbye to dull slides and hello to animated data storytelling.</p>
<p>In this talk, one of the creators of <a href="https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story">ipyvizzu-story</a> will demonstrate how this new open-source presentation tool, integrated with Jupyter Notebook and similar platforms, makes use of a simple Python interface to bring your data to life through animated stories.</p>
<p>We will delve into the syntax, logic, and evolution of ipyvizzu-story and the underlying chart morphing engine. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of when, why, and how to utilize this tool to its fullest potential.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>This talk will discuss our recent advancements in recycling finetuned models and collaborative pretraining. We would describe how to harness the data and computation invested in one or more models to collaboratively improve the pre-trained model they originated from, once or over and over again. The work will also touch on our initial understanding of how and why fusing several models by weight averaging works. All of these are small steps towards evolving pretrained models that we create together as a community, join us, check the best models and feel free to contact me and ask questions.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>We will talk about leveraging the power of pretrained transformer models by adjusting and fine-tuning to fit custom problems. We illustrate the flexibility by discussing diverse use cases that were part of recent kaggle competitions like question answering, sentiment segmentation, multilingual toxicity detection or ordering of the code cells in a jupyter notebook.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Whether you are a large corporation or a single person, getting started with machine learning is not easy, especially if you have little to no data. To overcome this cold-start problem, we would like to show you how to leverage state-of-the-art techniques to kickstart your next NLP project and get high-quality labels fast. We&rsquo;ll cover topics such as active learning, weak supervision as well as confident and zero-shot learning. Your hosts will be Moritz, Div, and Leo from the company Kern AI, who use these advanced techniques in their open-source data-centric IDE for NLP called “refinery”.</p>
